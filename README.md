Trying out Python PyQt GUI application development with these tutorials  
Goal is to create a boilerplate - to then rapidly develop applications with

GOALS  
-----  

Final TODOs  
- Finish videos 17/18/19 - that would be the end of the boilerplate base application concepts

002_pop_up_window.py  
- create a transparent timer? - or a clock that overlays on top of all windows?  

004_currency_converter.py
- needs rework - change the source of currency conversion data - rewrite this code

007_builtin_dialogs.py
- Need to figure out more ways to open Dialogs and Forms from one of the Forms (dumb dialogs, standard dialogs?)

- this one shows the new signal slot method style syntax from the older ones - not that important  
- emitting signals is also important - learn about this in detail when using GUI programming  
- myOwnSignal = Signal((int,), (str,))  <- use tuples also - this is acceptable - use commas to define tuples  
- Check after 20:00 - how to pass multiple parameters for the same signal - multiple signal handlers with tuples
